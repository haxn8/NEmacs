* Usage Disclaimer
You probably shouldn't use this configuration.

This Emacs configuration is provided as-is, and its functionality is intended for personal use. While I've made efforts to ensure its reliability,
please be aware of the following:

- I suck at Emacs Lisp, so there could be limitations, bugs, or performance issues.
- I also suck at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#:~:text=Free%20and%20open%2Dsource%20software%20(FOSS)%20is%20a%20term,are%20encouraged%20to%20improve%20the][FOSS]].
- This configuration might not be suitable for all use cases, and its behavior may change over time.
- I may not be able to provide immediate or comprehensive support in case of issues or feature requests.

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to report them by creating an issue.

By using my configuration, you agree to do so at your own discretion and understand that there may be limitations.

Also, please read the [[./LICENSE.txt][LICENSE]].
